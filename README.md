# ASCII Shall Receive

A long, long time ago I decided to learn Objective-C.

Bereft of useful ideas, I built nothing of consequence until one day
a name came from out of nowhere: "ASCII Shall Receive".

So I built it. For 68k and PowerPC Macs. Remember those? Heady days.

And somehow, improbably, a reference to the original still exists on
the internet to this day. Should it? Probably not. But nevertheless.

Never one to waste a good pun, I've created this trivial repo to keep
claim to the name.
